Structure:

    fixures: json data used by the tests.
    integration: the code for the tests themself
    support: custom commands and code that is run before all tests
    cypress.json: order in which tests are carried out

Best practices:

    Custom selectors used for testing are considered best practice.

Dashboard:

    Cypress Dashboard is free to use for non-commercial, open source projects. It may be a good idea to use this tool.

Other issues:

    Testing with shadow DOM. (I don't seem to be able to access these, but has not effected tests yet.)
